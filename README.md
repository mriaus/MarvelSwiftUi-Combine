# MarvelSwiftUi-Combine
This repository is an App using the Marvel api.
I list all the Marvel characters, then if you press in one you can see all the series.

This app works too with appleWatch (A bit WIP) and macOS (A bit WIP)

This app has been built using swiftUI + Combine

I have played too with testing 
I want to implement too a statusBox to control the errors better and a filter list

For use the app you need to put in Data/Network/Services/Constants:
The ts value
The apiKey
The Hash
